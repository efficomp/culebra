Wrapper subpackage
==================

This package provides an abstract base class for all the generarational
wrapper procedures:

* :py:mod:`wrapper.generational_wrapper`

And two generational wrapper procedures: a simple evolutionary algorithm and
another one, based on Non-dominated sorting, able to run NSGA-II and NSGA-III
algorithms:
 
* :py:mod:`wrapper.evolutionary_wrapper`
* :py:mod:`wrapper.nsga_wrapper`
