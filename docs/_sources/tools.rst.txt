Tools subpackage
================

This package provides several tools:

* Since individuals are generated and modified randomly, it is necessary an
  :doc:`Individual tester <tools/individual_tester>` to test extensively
  the random generation, crossover and mutation of all the
  :py:class:`~base.individual.Individual` implementations.

* Some :doc:`Feature metrics <tools/feature_metrics>` are also necessary to
  estimate the relevance of the input features from the
  :py:class:`~base.wrapper.Wrapper` results

* Automated experimentation is also a quite valuable characteristic when a
  :py:class:`~base.wrapper.Wrapper` method has to be run many times. Culebra
  provides this features by means of a `TOML
  <https://github.com/toml-lang/toml>`_ :doc:`configuration file
  <tools/config_file>` and the :py:mod:`~tools.config_manager` module, which
  is able to generate :doc:`experiments <tools/experiment>` and even
  :doc:`batchs of experiments <tools/batch>` from a single
  :doc:`configuration file <tools/config_file>`
