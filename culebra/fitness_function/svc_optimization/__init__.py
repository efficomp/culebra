"""Fitness functions for parameter optimization problems.

This module is composed by:

  * The :py:mod:`~culebra.fitness_function.svc_optimization.abc` sub-module,
    where some abstract base classes are defined to support fitness functions
    developed in this module

  * Some scoring fitness functions:

    * :py:class:`~culebra.fitness_function.svc_optimization.C`: Dummy
      single-objective function that minimizes the regularization parameter *C*
      of a SVM-based classifier with RBF kernels.

    * :py:class:`~culebra.fitness_function.svc_optimization.KappaIndex`:
      Single-objective function that maximizes the Kohen's Kappa index for a
      SVM-based classifier with RBF kernels.

    * :py:class:`~culebra.fitness_function.svc_optimization.Accuracy`:
      Single-objective function that maximizes the Accuracy for a
      SVM-based classifier with RBF kernels.
