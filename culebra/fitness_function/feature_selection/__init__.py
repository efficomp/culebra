"""Fitness functions related to feature selection.

This module is composed by:

  * The :py:mod:`~culebra.fitness_function.feature_selection.abc` sub-module,
    where some abstract base classes are defined to support fitness functions
    developed in this module

  * Some single-objective scoring fitness functions:

    * :py:class:`~culebra.fitness_function.feature_selection.NumFeats`: Dummy
      single-objective function that minimizes the number of selected features
      from a :py:class:`~culebra.tools.Dataset`.

    * :py:class:`~culebra.fitness_function.feature_selection.FeatsProportion`:
      Dummy single-objective function that minimizes the number of selected
      features from a :py:class:`~culebra.tools.Dataset`. The difference with
      :py:class:`~culebra.fitness_function.feature_selection.NumFeats` is just
      that
      :py:class:`~culebra.fitness_function.feature_selection.FeatsProportion`
      returns a normalized number in [0, 1].

    * :py:class:`~culebra.fitness_function.feature_selection.KappaIndex`:
      Single-objective function that maximizes the Kohen's Kappa index for
      classification problems.

    * :py:class:`~culebra.fitness_function.feature_selection.Accuracy`:
      Single-objective function that maximizes the Accuracy for classification
      problems.

  * A multi-objective fitness function that can aggregate several objectives:

    * :py:class:`~culebra.fitness_function.feature_selection.FSMultiObjectiveDatasetScorer`:
      Supports multi-objective FS on dataset-related problems
