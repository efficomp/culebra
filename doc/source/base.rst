Base subpackage
===============

Culebra is based in some base modules to define the fundamental pieces that are
necessary to solve a feature selection problem. The base subpackage defines:

* A :doc:`dataset <base/dataset>` with samples, where the most relevant input
  features need to be selected
* The :doc:`individuals <base/individual>`, which will be used within the
  wrapper method to search the best subset of features
* A :doc:`species <base/species>` to define the characteristics of the
  individuals
* The :doc:`fitness function <base/fitness>` to guide the search towards
  optimal solutions
* The :doc:`wrapper <base/wrapper>` method to perform the search
