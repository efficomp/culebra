Welcome to culebra's documentation!
===================================

Culebra is a `DEAP <https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/>`_-based
evolutionary computation library designed to solve feature selection problems.

It provides several individual representations, such as bitvectors and set
of feature indices, several fitness functions and several wrapper algorithms.

Experiments and experiment batchs are automatized by means of the 
:py:class:`~tools.experiment.Experiment` and :py:class:`~tools.batch.Batch`
classes, both in the :doc:`tools` subpackage.
