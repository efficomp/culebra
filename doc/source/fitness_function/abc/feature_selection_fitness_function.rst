:py:class:`culebra.fitness_function.abc.FeatureSelectionFitnessFunction` class
==============================================================================

.. autoclass:: culebra.fitness_function.abc.FeatureSelectionFitnessFunction

Class attributes
----------------
.. class:: culebra.fitness_function.abc.FeatureSelectionFitnessFunction.Fitness

    Handles the values returned by the
    :py:meth:`~culebra.fitness_function.abc.FeatureSelectionFitnessFunction.evaluate`
    method within a :py:class:`~culebra.abc.Solution`.

    This class must be implemented within all the
    :py:class:`~culebra.fitness_function.abc.FeatureSelectionFitnessFunction`
    subclasses, as a subclass of the :py:class:`~culebra.abc.Fitness` class,
    to define its three class attributes (
    :py:attr:`~culebra.abc.Fitness.weights`,
    :py:attr:`~culebra.abc.Fitness.names`, and
    :py:attr:`~culebra.abc.Fitness.thresholds`) according to the fitness
    function.
