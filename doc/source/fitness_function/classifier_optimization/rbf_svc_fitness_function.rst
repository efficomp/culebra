:py:class:`fitness_function.classifier_optimization.RBFSVCFitnessFunction` class
================================================================================

.. autoclass:: fitness_function.classifier_optimization.RBFSVCFitnessFunction

Class attributes
----------------
.. class:: fitness_function.classifier_optimization.RBFSVCFitnessFunction.Fitness

    Fitness class to handle the values returned by the
    :py:meth:`~fitness_function.classifier_optimization.RBFSVCFitnessFunction.evaluate` method
    within an :py:class:`~genotype.classifier_optimization.Individual`.

    This class must be implemented within all the
    :py:class:`~fitness_function.classifier_optimization.RBFSVCFitnessFunction`
    subclasses, as a subclass of the
    :py:class:`~base.Fitness` class, to define its three class attributes
    (:py:attr:`~base.Fitness.weights`, :py:attr:`~base.Fitness.names`, and
    :py:attr:`~base.Fitness.thresholds`) according to the fitness function.
