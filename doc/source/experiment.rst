:py:mod:`experiment` module
===========================

Automated experimentation is also a quite valuable characteristic when a
:py:class:`~base.Wrapper` method has to be run many times. Culebra provides
this features by means of a `TOML <https://github.com/toml-lang/toml>`_
:doc:`configuration file <config_file>` and the
:py:class:`~experiment.ConfigManager` class, which is able to generate
experiments and even batchs of experiments from a single configuration file.
