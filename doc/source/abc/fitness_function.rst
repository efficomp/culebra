    This class must be implemented within all the
    :py:class:`~culebra.abc.FitnessFunction` subclasses, as a subclass of the
    :py:class:`~culebra.abc.Fitness` class, to define its three class
    attributes (:py:attr:`~culebra.abc.Fitness.weights`,
    :py:attr:`~culebra.abc.Fitness.names`, and
    :py:attr:`~culebra.abc.Fitness.thresholds`) according to the fitness
    function.
